#### Purpose 

The main purpose of this project is to enable the company operating in the hotel sector to manage its daily operations more effectively and to optimize customer reservation processes.

Patika Tourism Agency makes agreements with many hotels and reserves hotel rooms for customers. The first person with admin authority from the agency will be recorded in the database by the software developer. The person with admin authority will also be able to log in to the system and add both admin and agency employees. Agency employees will register hotels and rooms in the system, search for rooms and make reservations according to customers' demands.

Hotel Management System aims to achieve these goals by offering features such as flexible pricing, detailed hotel and room management, ease of reservation and automatic calculation to agency employees with a user-friendly interface.

The agency thinks that doing these tasks manually and on paper is a waste of time, and it needs software that will make its job easier.
